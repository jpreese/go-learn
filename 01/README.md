# It's Go time!

## Objectives
1. Set up your environment to program in Go
1. Introduce `Modules` and `Packages`
1. Write your first unit test

## Setting up your environment (10 minutes)

1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Download [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
1. Install the `Go` extension for VSCode (found in Extensions within VSCode)
1. Run `Go: Install/Update Tools` from the [command pallette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)
1. Set your VS Code settings

```yaml
    "go.useLanguageServer": true,
    "go.autocompleteUnimportedPackages": true,
    "go.toolsEnvVars": {
        "GO111MODULE": "on"
    },
    "[go]": {
        "editor.snippetSuggestions": "none",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": true,
        }
    },
    "gopls": {
        "usePlaceholders": true, // add parameter placeholders when completing a function
        "completeUnimported": true, // autocomplete unimported packages
        "watchFileChanges": true,  // watch file changes outside of the editor
        "deepCompletion": true,     // enable deep completion
    }
```

NOTE: These settings are not _required_ to use Go, but are recommended. You are welcome to change them to better suit your preferences.

## Introducing Concepts (10 minutes)

**Package**
A collection of code files that provide _functionality_

- Should be named after the folder that the file is contained in
- Packages can span multiple files
- Should expose functionality, not data

**Module**
A collection of packages that are _versioned together_

- Typically named after the URL where the repository lives
- Uses Git tags that follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Downloaded to your `module cache` which can be found at `$GOPATH/pkg`
- Can use a _proxy_ to store releases (e.g. [proxy.golang.org](https://proxy.golang.org))
- `sum` database stores hash to verify integrity of the module

## Problem (30 minutes)

Write a function that takes a single `string` argument and prefixes the argument with `Hello, `. For example, if the input is `Banana`, the result should be: `Hello, Banana`.

Print the result to the console, and prove your functionality works with a unit test.

### Getting Started

0. *OPTIONAL* Create a **GitHub repository** to store your code in. With the free tier, you can have an unlimited number of private repositories if you wish to not have your code public. This will allow you to easily persist your code if you ever wish to refer back to it. As we progress, it can also end up as a good portfolio of Go code that you've written.

1. Run `go mod init greeter` in the root of your project. If you want your code accessible outside of this project, the name of your module should be a URL. For example `github.com/account/greet`.

1. Create a `.go` file (e.g. `greet.go`) and add a `func` called `main()`

1. To build your program run: `go build`. This will create an executable which can then be run.

Alternatively, you can run: `go run greet.go` to run your application without creating a binary.

### Testing

1. The `Go` toolchain expects tests to appended with `_test.go`. In other words, if you have a file called `greet.go`, you should have a test in the same directory named `greet_test.go`.

1. `Go` has a package purpose-built for testing called `testing`. At the top of your test file, be sure to include `import "testing"` at the top of your file.

1. `Go` expects all tests to start with the word `Test`. The name of your test should start with `Test...` and take a single parameter `(t *testing.T)`

1. To report a test failure, you can use `t.Error()` or `t.Errorf()`

1. To run your tests, you can run: `go test`.

### Bonus

If you finish with the problem early, help others who are still working through it! Alternatively, consider adding these features:

1. Add your function to a package so that others can import it (leaving everything within the same project is fine, just put it along side your `main` program).

1. Update the function such that if the user passes in a blank string, an error is returned. 
    - Your `main` program should then check for the error. 
    - A unit test should be written to prove an error is returned.

1. Add a new function to the package that takes in multiple names at once and returns all of the greetings for those names.
    - If no names are passed in, you should return an error.
    - Update your `main` program to use this new function with multiple names.
    - A unit test should be written to prove that an error is returned and the return contains all of the expected greetings.
